# Advanced Calculator Project

## Overview
This project is a collaborative effort to build an advanced calculator in Python. The calculator will support various mathematical operations, including basic arithmetic, advanced functions, trigonometric calculations, memory operations, and history tracking. This README provides instructions for setting up the project and contributing to its development.

## Project Structure
The project consists of the following files and directories:

- **main.py**: The main program file responsible for user interaction and coordinating operations.
- **basic_operations.py**: Module for basic arithmetic operations.
- **advanced_operations.py**: Module for advanced mathematical functions.
- **trig_functions.py**: Module for trigonometric functions.
- **memory_functions.py**: Module for memory functions.
- **history.py**: Module for tracking operation history.
- **tests/**: Directory containing unit tests for each module.
